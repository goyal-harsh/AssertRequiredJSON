# AssertRequiredJSON

This Method is developed to Assert Partial JSON and only verify the Required Content from the JSON Response received from the request.

Can be used to only verify certain Partial JSON Body and help us from writing Assertions for individual nodes in JSON.

It considers the requiredJSON as the Structural Reference and then only checks the values for these nodes in the Response JSON.
